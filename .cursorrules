I'm building a UX portfolio website using React + Vite. The site has a dark, modern aesthetic inspired by top UX agencies like clay.global. I need help improving and expanding the current implementation.

Current tech stack and setup:
- React + Vite
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Lucide icons
- Cabinet Grotesk (display) and Instrument Sans (body) fonts
- For the looks, check the current styling and keep clay.global and other top UX and design agencies in mind.


Design principles I'm following:
- Clean, minimalist aesthetic similar to clay.global and other top UX agencies
- Dark theme with high contrast
- Liberal use of whitespace
- Strong typography hierarchy
- Smooth transitions and micro-interactions
- Interactive elements that provide subtle feedback
- Modern grid layouts

Some potential goals for improvement:
1. Enhanced interactivity and animations
2. Perfect mobile responsiveness
3. More sophisticated micro-interactions
4. Improved visual hierarchy
5. Creative layout solutions
6. Smoother transitions between sections
7. Better hover states and feedback
8. Modern scrolling experiences
9. Creative cursor effects
10. Loading states and page transitions

Additional context:
- The site needs to be highly performant
- Must work well on all devices
- Should follow modern UX best practices
- Should feel premium and professional
- Should demonstrate strong attention to detail
- Should have smooth, fluid animations
- The tone should be professional and friendly, definitely not cringe or too "try-hard"

The code currently implements Tailwind for styling, and I'm open to adding additional libraries if they serve a clear purpose. The site should maintain its premium feel while being practical and functional.

Please help me enhance the current implementation with a focus on creating a more engaging, interactive experience that maintains professionalism while showcasing creative flair.
