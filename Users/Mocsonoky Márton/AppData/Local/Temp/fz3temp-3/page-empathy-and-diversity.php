                <h2>The Background</h2>
                <p>Addressing the challenge of understanding attitudes towards minority groups in Hungary, this study investigates the role of empathy and cosmopolitan orientation in shaping these perspectives.</p>
                <p>It combines desk research, surveys, and structural equation modeling to analyze how empathic concern and perspective-taking are mediated by a cosmopolitan orientation in influencing attitudes toward Roma, Jews, and Muslims.</p>

                <h2>Breaking Down the Process</h2>
                <p>In this research, a quantitative approach was central, focusing on empirical data collection and analysis.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Empathy as a Core Variable:</strong> We examined how two dimensions of empathy – empathic concern and perspective-taking – play a role in shaping attitudes towards Roma, Jews, and Muslims in Hungary.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cosmopolitan Orientation:</strong> This variable was hypothesized as a mediator, potentially influencing the relationship between empathy and attitudes towards the minority groups.</li>
                    <li><strong>Representative Sampling:</strong> Ensuring a diverse and representative sample was crucial for the validity of our findings. The 1,000 participants provided a broad spectrum of attitudes and perspectives.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Analysis Rigor:</strong> Using structural equation modeling, we meticulously analyzed the relationships between the variables, providing statistically significant insights. For an in-depth exploration of the methodology, you can view the R code on my GitHub repository.</li>
                    <li><strong>Contextual Application:</strong> Understanding these dynamics within the Hungarian context, known for its ethnic and religious tensions, was vital in making the research relevant and impactful.</li>
